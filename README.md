This app is only viewable with the appropriate node configuration.

This app allows you to track your favorite websites by includining the following info:
  --Title
  --URL link
  --A short description
  --And a convenience rating
  
When you first open the app you will be able to see a list of your saved bookmarks.
When you log new bookmarks they will be posted and stored to the following URL:https://thinkful-list-api.herokuapp.com/theo/bookmarks

Once a bookmark is no longer useful you can click the delete button to remove it from your list.

In order to add a new bookmark you must simply click the "Create New Bookmark" button.

You must complete the required title and URL fields in order to successfully submit a bookmark.

You can assign your bookmarks a value rating and filter through them by clicking the "Filter" button. 

This app uses fetch for AJAX calls and jQuery for DOM manipulation and employs namespacing in order to adhere to good architecture practices.

The app is steamlined by employing a mobile-first media query.

This app is a work in progress. Any advice or criticsm is more than welcome. I am still learning, but I always intend to put my best foot forward.
