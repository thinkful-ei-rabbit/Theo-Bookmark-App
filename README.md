This app allows you to track your favorite websites by including the following info:

  --Title
  --URL link
  --A short description
  --And a convenience rating
  
When you first open the app you will be able to see a list of your saved bookmarks.
When you log new bookmarks they will be posted and stored to the following URL:https://thinkful-list-api.herokuapp.com/theo/bookmarks

The bookmarks you save will be rendered to the home page. There is a button on each list item that gives you the option to expand the box to elaborate more information.

Once a bookmark is no longer useful you can click the delete button to remove it from your list.

In order to add a new bookmark you must simply click the "Create New Bookmark" button.

You must complete the required title and URL fields in order to successfully submit a bookmark.

You can assign your bookmarks a value rating and filter through them by clicking the "Filter" button. 

This app uses fetch for AJAX calls and jQuery for DOM manipulation and employs namespacing in order to adhere to good architecture practices.

The app is streamlined for small screens by employing a mobile-first media query.

This app is a work in progress. Any advice or criticism would be greatly appreciated moving forward.
